## 1. About the game<br />
This game involves two persons(ex. Tom, Jack). Each of the player will think of a sequence of 4 digit number without duplicate such as 1234 or 4705. One of the player need to guess another player's answer. During the guessing process, Tom will guess a sequence of number and Jack will response the guessing with two number A and B.  A represents the number of digit with correct value as well as the correct position. B represents the number of digit with correct value but wrong position.
